Garden Quest III The legend of Stella is a text based game that takes place in the Museum of Fine Art Houstons sculpture garden. Houston Art New Generation got their inspiration for the game from a retro text based game called Zork. HANG spent many months planning the paths of the game and gathering interesting information about the sculptures and artists. The game is currently still operational.

You play the game by texting “Start” to 713-568-3234, you will then receive a text message leading you to a sculpture. You will get clues in order to find a specific sculpture along with a question regarding the artwork. Once you answer the question you will continue looking for sculptures using the information provided. There are two different paths you can choose along with an easter egg hidden somewhere in the game. Will you be the one to find the easter egg? Go play our game to find out!
